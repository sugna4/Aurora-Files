			<p>There are countless situations where sabotage, terrorism, catastrophic failure, and bombings have changed the course of history. A true Saboteur knows that any goal is achievable with enough explosives. If a job has a car that needs stopping, a skyscraper that needs dropping, or a person that needs popping, then look no further. The real challenge for the Sabotuer is knowing when to stop. Some Saboteurs let the force multpliers at their fingertips go to their head, becoming a mad bomber. In these cases, self-destruction is inevitable, but at least its always one hell of a fireworks show.</p>
