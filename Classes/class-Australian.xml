		<description>
			<p>Stumbling out from a dark alleyway, a figure croaks out towards the open street "anyone spare some bucks for a fuckin beeeer?"</p>
			<p class="indent">Australian's are almost always intoxicated and certainly always swearing their heads off.</p>
			<p class="indent">Their love for footy and pies, always paired together, is almost a dangerous addiction</p>
			<p class="indent">The only thing that can frighten an Australian, is their home team losing in the footy.</p>
			<h4>SKILLS AND INTRESTS</h4>
			<p>Aussies are about as varied as they come, depending on where they are from, or depending on what apprenticeship they did, different aussies will always have different skillsets</p>
			<p class="indent">dispite this, all aussies are masters of fighting wild creatures and are mostly immune to poison.</p>
			<h4>AN INDEPENDENT UPBRINGING</h4>
			<p>Growing up in such open spaces, Aussie's explore their enviroment and explore where their limits lie, often realising that they in fact, dont actually have limits at all.</p>
			<p class="indent">As adventurers, Aussies fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating pubs and bars in search of a drink.</p>
			<h4>CREATING AN AUSSIE</h4>
			<p>As you create your Australian character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry tavern master? Or did you leave your home in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p>
			<p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great bender or trip gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful lottery gave you the coin you needed to escape the boredom of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make an Australian quickly by following these suggestions. First, Constitution should be your highest ability score. Make Strength your next-highest if you want to excel at barfighting. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize seduction and social interaction. Second, choose the criminal background.</p>
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
			<p>As an AUSSIE, you have the following class features.</p>
			<h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per Aussie level</li>

			<p>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn three cantrips: mage hand and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spell Slots.</i></b> The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</i></b> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
